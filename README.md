In this game, you play as a student sitting in the Metaforum library. Your goal is to eat snacks or whisper to your friends without getting caught by the librarian. The game works a bit like “Red Light, Green Light”: When the librarian is looking away, you can act. When the librarian is watching, you must stay still or you get caught!
