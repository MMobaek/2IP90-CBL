
/**
 * In this game, you play as a student sitting in the Metaforum library. 
 * Your goal is to eat snacks or whisper to your friends 
 * without getting caught by the librarian. 
 * The game works a bit like “Red Light, Green Light”:
 * When the librarian is looking away, you can act. 
 * When the librarian is watching, you must stay still or you get caught!
